Covid-19 Pandas Reports

Goal is to build a report with plots of the statewise confirmed and deth curves and to calculate the slope of the line for the past five days running for each period so we can see the change in the slope of the line.

Currently the notebook loads and processes the data produceing the plots and the slope for the last five days.

todo: calculate slope for all days for past five days.
todo: develop dashboard.
